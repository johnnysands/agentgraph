# AgentGraph

Agent Graph is a generic execution framework to execute a DAG of dependent computations.  The goal
is to make it easy to define complex multi-step actions for agents in a way that is powerful but
relatively simple.

Right now it's just a skeleton of the execution engine, which supports parallel execution.

For usage examples, see the tests and examples.

The API is still under development, and the goal is to make it easier to use from here.
